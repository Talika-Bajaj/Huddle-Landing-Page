# Frontend Mentor - Huddle landing page with single introductory section

## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 15th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

I have created a Huddle landing page with a single introductory section considering mobile-first design with help of HTML and CSS. 

This challenge helped me work with two-column layout which enhanced my CSS Grid Layout skills and also helped me create a responsive design.

**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
